This repository contains simulation code for "An Optimal Computing Budget Allocation Tree Policy for Monte Carlo Tree Search" by Yunchuan Li, Michael Fu and Jie Xu.

For inventory control problem, run script `inventory_control.py` with appropriate inputs. Please put `monte_carlo_tree_search.py` and `analysis.py` under the same folder. 
Checkpoints will be saved for each budget. After running, the figures are generated by `analysis.py`.

For tic-tac-toe, run script `tic_tac_toe.py` with appropriate inputs. Please put `monte_carlo_tree_search_tic_tac_toe.py` and `tic_tac_toe_analysis.py` under the same folder. 
Checkpoints will be saved for each budget. After running, the figures are generated by `tic_tac_toe_analysis.py`. Note that you may need to adjust the location of the legend for different experiments.
There is no one-size-fits-all location option.
